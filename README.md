# PongDS

## Explanation:

This is a port of the Python pong game I made a while back, made specifically to run on the Nintendo DS.

The top screen shows the game, the bottom screen displays the score.



### Future updates:

- Use libnds' built-in sinLerp() and cosLerp() (fixed point)

- Multiplayer mode (Wireless/LAN)

- Better music

- Power-ups / Obstacles (to make the game interesting)



## Controls:

- [START] -> Start game


- [DPad Up/Down] -> Move your paddle



## Compilation:

In order to compile the source, you will need the devkitPro.


Then, in the root folder, run the Makefile with:

```make```



## Development information:

Developed by: SammygoodTunes


Library(ies) used: libnds, maxmod9
